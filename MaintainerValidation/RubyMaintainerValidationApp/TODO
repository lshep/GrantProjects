Bug Fix: Have an Update when an email or name is updated for a given package

Build out GET endpoint to query database
      / to give a list of available endpoints
     
      ?? update list invalid emails to also give email_status (theoretically if
      can get bounce/failure/etc status from ses)

Update core.db to integrate with ses to retrieve bounced/failed emails and
update email_status 

Dashboard view of database?
