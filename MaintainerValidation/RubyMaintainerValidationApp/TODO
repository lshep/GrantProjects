Bug Fix: Have an Update when an email or name is updated for a given package

Build out GET endpoint to query database
      / to give a list of available endpoints
      give a package, print all info
      give a name print all info (packages, is valid)
      give a email is it valid/consented
      give a email print all info (packages, is valid)
      endpoint to list all invalid emails
      endpoint to list all not consented
      endpoint to list combo all invalid and not consented

Update core.db to integrate with ses to retrieve bounced/failed emails and
update email_status 

Dashboard view of database?
